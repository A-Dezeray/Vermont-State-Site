          <h3>Montpelier (Capital)</h3>
        </a>
        <p>"Montpelier has the distinction of being the smallest <strong> state capital</strong> in the United States,
          with a population of just over 8,000 people. It's a small town with big city amenities - a lively arts and
          music scene, great restaurants (largely due to the presence of the New England Culinary Institute), excellent
          schools, and an active community life - there are lots of opportunities to participate in local government,
          recreation, the faith and wisdom communities, and healthy lifestyles."

        <h3>Historic Sites</h3>
        <p>The Vermont Division for Historic Preservation’s State-Owned Historic Sites Program encourages the discovery
          and appreciation of our rich heritage through the stewardship and interpretation of historic sites that evoke
          an authentic sense of time and place. One way that the state-owned historic sites fulfill this mission is
          through an active exhibition program. Most of the sites have permanent exhibitions that interpret their unique
          history, as well as regularly changing displays that focus on specialized subjects.</p>

        <h3>Fish and Wildlife</h3>
        <p>The department's mission is "the conservation of fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the people
          of Vermont."
          <br>
          <br>
          Other challenges include providing quality fish and wildlife-based recreation and reaching Vermonters with the best possible information about these resources.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department is one of three departments in the Agency of Natural Resources. Our $20 million (annual budget) is funded by three major sources: user-based fees such as licenses, excise taxes on gasoline and on hunting and fishing equipment, and state general funds.</p>
